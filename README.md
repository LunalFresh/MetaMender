# MetaMender

**MetaMender** is a lightweight, AI-powered metadata enhancer for Jellyfin.
It enriches your media library by rewriting short or missing overviews for music items using your preferred language model ‚Äî no servers, no Docker, no complexity.

---

## üéØ What It Does

- Scans your Jellyfin library for albums and artists with poor or missing descriptions
- Uses your configured model to generate high-quality, streaming-style summaries
- Automatically applies changes through the Jellyfin API
- Keeps a full log of changes with before/after text and token usage
- Designed to be terminal-based and lightweight

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Copy `config.template.json` and rename it to `config.json`.
2. Open `config.json` and fill in the required fields:
   - Jellyfin server URL
   - Jellyfin API key
   - Your Jellyfin user ID
   - API keys for the model provider you wish to use (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
3. (Optional) Specify a preferred model or item types to target and choose a `model_provider`.

> Note: `config.json` is excluded from the repo to keep your credentials secure.

### üìö Model Provider Options

Set the `"model_provider"` field in your `config.json` to one of these values:

| `model_provider` | Description              | Required Config Keys                   | Example `"model"`       |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `openai`         | OpenAI API (default)    | `openai_api_key`, `model`              | `"gpt-4o"`              |
| `anthropic`      | Anthropic Claude        | `anthropic_api_key`, `model`           | `"claude-3-haiku-20240307"` |
| `google`         | Google Gemini           | `google_api_key`, `model`              | `"gemini-pro"`          |
| `local`          | Ollama (local models)   | Ollama server running, `model`         | `"llama3"`, `"mistral"` |

#### Example configs:

**OpenAI**:
```json
{
  "model_provider": "openai",
  "openai_api_key": "sk-...",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  ...
}
````

**Anthropic**:

```json
{
  "model_provider": "anthropic",
  "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-...",
  "model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
  ...
}
```

**Google**:

```json
{
  "model_provider": "google",
  "google_api_key": "AIza...",
  "model": "gemini-pro",
  ...
}
```

**Local (Ollama)**:

```json
{
  "model_provider": "local",
  "model": "llama3",
  ...
}
```

> For Ollama, ensure you have the model pulled and your local Ollama server is running (`ollama serve`).

### How to Choose

* **`openai`**: Use for ChatGPT models with an OpenAI API key.
* **`anthropic`**: Use for Claude models if you have access.
* **`google`**: Use for Gemini models with a Google API key.
* **`local`**: Use for running LLMs on your own machine via Ollama.

---

## üß™ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the script: `metamender.py`

If everything is already well-described, the app will tell you ‚Äî otherwise, it starts updating automatically.

---

## üßæ Logs

Each run generates a timestamped log in the `logs/` folder. These logs show:

* Item names and types
* Original vs. generated overviews
* Token usage and estimated API cost
* Any skipped items with HTTP error codes

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

If the API returns an error for an item, MetaMender logs a warning with
that item's ID and skips the update. These items are counted as "skipped" in the
final summary.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

* Support for TV shows, movies, books, and more
* Optional manual approval before applying changes
* Background auto-run support
* Clean web-based UI
* **AI-generated images for items missing artwork** (via OpenAI‚Äôs image model)
* Token tracking and usage analytics
